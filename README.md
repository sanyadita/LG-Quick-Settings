# LG Quick Settings

This is an Android app for LG smartphones  which have QuickCircle feature. Android minimum version - 6.0 (sdk 23). It helps to turn on/off Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, to change volume level, sound mode and brightness level, to check if mobile data and GPS are turned on and to check battery percentage. Also for DualSim smartphones it shows current default sim card. Doesn’t need root.

Unfortunately, mobile data, GPS and SIM card can’t be changed for now, because required permission is available only for system applications.

Download apk file, copy it to your device and open to install. Then go to ‘Settings’ -> ‘QuickCircle case’,select LG Quick Settings application and press ‘Save’ 

Was tested on LG G3 Dual and LG G3s.

P.S. Next version will have customization menu. So user will be able to choose items color and order.
